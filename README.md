__Pull text from images, screen captures, or videos (when paused)__.

Temp image files and text files are being dropped in __/tmp__.

I think the best way to set this is up is by creating a keyboard shortcut. When you need text from images or vids,
you can (example key shortcut) __[ ctrl + alt + j ]__ and gnome-screenshot instantly starts, once captured you __[ ctrl + p ]__.

This works pretty well and the speed is great.
