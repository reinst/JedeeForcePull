__Pull text from images, screen captures, or videos (when paused)__.

When teaching myself coding, this tool allows me to pull code from training videos instead of typing (I always type an error). It also allows me to pull text from a .pdf loaded in a browser which doesn't allow copy.

I think the best way to set this is up is by creating a keyboard shortcut. When you need text from images or vids,
you can (example keyboard shortcut) __[ ctrl + alt + j ]__ and gnome-screenshot instantly starts, once captured you __[ ctrl + p ]__.

Temp image files and text files are being dropped in __/tmp__.

This works pretty well and the speed is great.
